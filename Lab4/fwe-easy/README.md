<h1 align="center">Lab 4: Advanced Enumeration & Firewall Evasion</h1>

<p align="center"><em>Think like an attacker. Probe like a professional.</em></p>

---

## Setup

Clone the repo and navigate to the challenge directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ENPM634Corp/Labs.git
cd Labs/Lab4/fwe-easy
docker compose up -d
```

---

## Getting Started

All lab tasks, setup steps, and deliverables are outlined in one place:

> **[`Instructions.md`](Instructions.md)** - Start here.

Read through it carefully before you begin. It contains everything you need: environment setup, the challenge objective, hints, and submission requirements.

## What You'll Need

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Docker** | Runs the target environment locally |
| **Nmap** | Network scanning and enumeration |
| **Terminal** | Your command line of choice |
| **Curiosity** | The most important tool you have |

---

## Quick Reference

```
1.  Read Instructions.md
2.  Pull and launch the Docker lab environment
3.  Enumerate the target
4.  Evade the firewall
5.  Capture the flag
6.  Write up your findings and submit
```

---

## Rules & Guidelines

- **Work individually** unless told otherwise by your instructor.
- **Do not share flags** with other students.
- **Do not attack** any systems outside of the provided Docker environment.
- **Document everything** - your write-up is as important as finding the flag.
- **Ask questions** if you get stuck; struggling is expected, suffering in silence is not.
