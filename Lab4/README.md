<p align="center"><em>Think like an attacker. Probe like a professional.</em></p>

---

## Challenges

| Challenge | Difficulty | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **[FWE-Easy](fwe-easy/)** | Standard | Identify firewall filtering and evade it to retrieve a hidden service banner |
| **[FWE-Challenge](fwe-challenge/)** | Advanced | The firewall got an upgrade — and trust issues. Think you can sneak past it? |

## Rules & Guidelines

- **Work individually** unless told otherwise by your instructor.
- **Do not share flags** with other students.
- **Do not attack** any systems outside of the provided Docker environment.
- **Document everything** - your write-up is as important as finding the flag.
- **Ask questions** if you get stuck; struggling is expected, suffering in silence is not.
